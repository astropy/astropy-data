# Astropy Data Server

[![GitHub Actions CI Status](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-data/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-data/actions)

This repository is the source for the astropy data server (http://data.astropy.org).
You should issue PRs here to add data to the server, but note that it has to be mirrored by the main server to actually appear at http://data.astropy.org.
